## About the Game

"Gummy Worms" is an online game inspired on the classic "Snake" game, but in bright colors!
It is designed to entertain busy people that have no time for long gaming hours, full of involvement and commitment.
This game is the perfect break for the nostalgic busy millenial parent, but people of all ages will find it easy-going and enjoyable.

The game can be accessed by a link on the browser and different levels bring a little bit of challenge to the experience as the gamer progresses with the possibility to see their final score.

## Planning phase
### User Experience (UX)

#### User stories

As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a reason/a value]

**First Time Visitor Goals**
1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to immediately understand the main purpose of the site. 
2. I want to be able to quickly understand the game controls and mechanics in order to enjoy playing the game
3. I want to find more information about the game and to be able to consult the instructions to the game. 
4. I want to be able to see my score as I play the game.
5. I want to be able to be challenged with harder levels as I progress.
6. I would like to play a simple game, with a fairly short play time, but high entertaining value.
7. I want to see my final score and how that compares to other people.
8. I want to have fun and feel inclined to play it again or at a later time.

Considering that there is no possibility to login and make a previous score better at the moment, all users are considered "first time visitors".

#### Strategy

<details>
<summary>Project Goals</summary>
The purpose of this project is to build an interactive website, using JavaScript. The website should have fun colors and provide fun entertainment. The user should feel good about playing the game and want to play it again immediately after or at a later time.

Although it is a simple game, in comparison to what is available today, this game has the nostalgic appeal of the classic "Snake" game. In this project, the main goal is to make sure that the user decides to play the game and can quicly figure out the controls and game mechanics. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Business Goals</summary>
The main goal of the website is to offer a game to attract players. 
This is the first ever developed game for "Gummy Worms" and it runs on the browser.
The game is free, but it is a good way to test for features before potentially developing it further or even creating a paid version. Developing and deploying a game in this manner can save time, by just "shipping it" with the MVP (minimun viable product) and later iterating and improving it little by little.

**Audience:** the game targets mainly busy nostalgic "millenials", that is people in the age range 25-40. 
However, people of all ages can enjoy the game. Basic knowledge of English is helpful to read the instructions and "about section", but not a requirement to play.
While most people all over the world alrealdy know somewhat how to play this game, due to the popularity of the "Snake" game in the old Nokia phones, our main audience consists of busy and nostalgic "millenial" parents. So our marketing language is adapted this group of people.

#### Scope



#### Structure



#### Skeleton

This section illustrates the first draft of the website and how the information will be presented.

<details>
<summary>Wireframes</summary>

- A first draft was sketched by hand on paper and then Balsamiq was used for the final wireframes.

#### Surface
##### Design

###### Color Scheme

- The colors chosen were based on sour gummy worms candy colors. Light rose, coral, aquamarine, light mint and light yellow.
- These colors were chosen to represent the following keywords, respectively: sweet, vintage (although "Tigerlilly" a more orange shade was the Pantone color of the year 2004), sour, fresh, happy/bright.

![Color Palette](https://github.com/adrinecl/milestone-project2/blob/master/docs/images/gummy-worms-game-color-palette.png)


###### Typography

- The following fonts were chosen for this project: "Fredoka One" for the logo and headings and "Roboto" for the body, with the alternative of "sans-serif" as back-up. Available at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka+One?preview.text=Gummy%20Worms&preview.text_type=custom&category=Serif,Display,Handwriting#pairings).

###### Imagery

- The overall design should be quite clean and straightforward with focus on the functionality, since the pastel and bright colors can be quite overpowering. The game should convey a sense of happiness, youth and nostalgia. If any other imagery is used, it should depict candy or icons as metaphors for the functionality of different buttons and other information relevant to the user.
